Here I created a mini survey asking whether you're a milk tea or a fruit tea.
Just to be more interactive, I wanted to allow users to enter any username and
enter the "secret" password MilkTea to enter to the survey. Once the users answer each
question, they're shown a text result and image of what they got.

In my application I included:

//creating a survey asking whether you're a milk tea or fruit tea

//creating the survey to choose based on what side was chosen most. 

//once submitted, images would should what kind of tea they are.
